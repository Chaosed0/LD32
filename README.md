S-COM Aftermath
===========

The alien invasion is over, but humanity's problems are just beginning. With the psionic abilities and plasma weapons left behind, the nations are now turning inward and beginning pointless wars. In the midst of this conflict, the S-COM project is one again activated - but this time, to preserve order.

Strike a careful balance between the continents, and develop the Mind-Control bomb before one of them falls into chaos - or the world will go with it...

This game is, of course, based on the story of X-COM. In the latest remake (Enemy Unknown), there's lots of questioning about "what happens after the aliens are gone/what do we do with all this tech/how will it change humanity?" but the game never explores the idea. Here's my take on it, in strategy-game spreadsheet-crunching continent-clicking form.

This was entered in [Ludum Dare 32](http://ludumdare.com/compo/), meaning everything (code, assets) was created in 48 hours.
