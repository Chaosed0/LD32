                <p>Your goal is to develop the mind-control bomb. Progress toward the bomb is displayed at the bottom of the screen, and it goes up every month depending on how many scientists you have. The bomb must be developed before any continent is lost, which happens if a continent's stability falls below zero.</p>
                <p>A continent's stability goes down if it is at war with another continent which has a greater strength. When you select a continent, its enemies are displayed at the top-left under "Wars". The number next to each enemy denotes the difference in strength; if the number is negative, the continent's stability will go down by that amount. Stability can never be regained. Wars are also denoted by red lines on the map.</p>
                <p>Strength increases every turn depending on how many scientists continent has. You can increase a continent's research by sending them scientists, but this slows down your progress on the mind-control bomb. You can give their strength a temporary boost by deploying squadrons. Finally, you can deploy an agent to prevent any stability loss for as long as the agent is present. You can trade scientists, squads and agents by accepting offers made by continents at the beginning of each month.</p>
                <p>That's about it, commander. Good luck.</p>

                <p>Commander. This council has approved the re-activation of the X-MOC project. In the aftermath of the alien attacks, nations everywhere have obtained weaponry far exceeding what was available before. We did not anticipate the extent of the chaos that has ensued.</p>
                <p>World war is upon us, but we have some unconventional weaponry of our own. As commander of X-MOC, you must maintain the balance between continent while our scientists research and manufacture the bomb. We will then use it as... leverage, to maintain order.</p>
                <p>Good luck, Commander. We trust that you will handle this matter with discretion.</p>
