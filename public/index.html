                <p>Your goal is to develop the mind-control bomb. Your progress toward the bomb is displayed at the bottom of the screen, and it goes up every month depending on how many scientists you have. You must develop the bomb before any continent is lost, which happens if a continent's stability falls below zero.</p>
                <p>A continent's stability falls if it is at war with another continent which is stronger than it. When you select a continent, its enemies are displayed at the top-left under "Wars". The number next to each enemy denotes the relative strength of the two countries. If the number is negative, that means the selected continent is losing that war; if it is positive, the continent is winning. Wars are also denoted by red lines on the map.</p>
                <p>Strength increases every turn depending on a continent's research score. You can increase a continent's research by sending them scientists, but this slows down your progress on the mind-control bomb. You can give their strength a temporary boost by deploying squadrons. Finally, you can deploy an agent to prevent any stability loss for as long as the agent is present. You can trade scientists, squads and agents by accepting offers made by continents at the beginning of each month.</p>
                <p>That's about it, commander. Good luck.</p>
